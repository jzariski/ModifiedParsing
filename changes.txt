Change Log between blockParse.py and blockParseFinal.py

Note: Most changes involved adding in checks for g-percent where normally
      gc-percent is checked. Beyond that changes involve adding in a reverse
      compliment check as well as adding a '+' or '-' to the .fastq depending
      on said check.


Changes related to G-percent Check:
Lines 71-72: Added values for needed for gpercent check, similar to gcpercent check
Line 98: Added value numG on a strand, similar to numGC
Lines 177-245: Added various operations and checks mirroring those for gc
Lines 248-364: Again mirrored operations for gc, simply subbing in plain g values
Lines 378-381: Added gCheck definition using above values
Line 478: Indicates the use of gCheck definition
Lines 581-621: Error windows for gCheck

 


Changes related to Reverse Compliment Check:
Line 116: Tracks reverse compliment check status
Line 119: Similar check but for added .fastq column
Line 121: Another similar check for writing the reverse sequence to .fastq
Lines 383-393: Checks reverse strand for G-percent
Line 487: Checks reverse strand if indicated along with gcheck
Line 493: Indicates to write '-' to .fastq file
Line 495: Inidcates to write reverse compliment to .fastq file
Lines 735-758: Various uses of the rPass value to indicate which strand to 
               print on .fastq--more in comments on section.
Lines 789-794: Writing the reverse compliment to file

Argument Changes:
-RC turns on reverse compliment check
-GON turns on gCheck instead of gcCheck
-g/-G are min and max G allowed respecitvely
-gc/-GC are min and max GC allowed respecitvely
